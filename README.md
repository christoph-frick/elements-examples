# Elements examples

These are the Vaadin Elements demos implemented with
[Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)

The project is built with SpringBoot, vaadin4spring, and gradle. After cloning
the project you can say

    ./gradlew bootRun

to start it. After a while the app should be available at
[localhost](http://localhost:8080).

IntelliJ project files can be created with

    ./gradlew idea

after which you can import the project to IntelliJ.
